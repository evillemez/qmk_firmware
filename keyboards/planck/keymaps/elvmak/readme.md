# Generated Keymap Layout

This layout was generated by the QMK API. You can find the JSON data used to
generate this keymap in the file layers.json.

To make use of this file you will need follow the following steps:

* Download or Clone QMK Firmware: <https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/>
* Extract QMK Firmware to a location on your hard drive
* Copy this folder into %s
* You are now ready to compile or use your keymap with the source

More information can be found in the QMK docs: <https://docs.qmk.fm>

## Notes from ELV

The general guide for how to build/flash the firmware via Docker is online here: https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/development-environments/getting_started_docker

I'm including the highlights below in case the link breaks in the future:

After cloning the repo, make sure submodules are included and initialized:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

To just build:

    util/docker_build.sh <keyboard>:<keymap>
    # For example: util/docker_build.sh planck/rev6:elvmak

To build AND flash: 

    util/docker_build.sh keyboard:keymap:target
    # For example: util/docker_build.sh planck/rev6:elvmak:dfu-util
